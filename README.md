pixel-sprite-generator
======================

JavaScript implementation of a procedural pixel sprite generator similar to the old days of video game sprites. The sprites are algorithmically generated by combinatorial methods.

## Algorithm

The sprites are generated by using a two dimensional mask. The values in the mask are then randomized and mirrored. The resulting template is rendered to a canvas element.
